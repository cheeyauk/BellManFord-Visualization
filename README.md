# BellManFord 
** Introduction **

Introduced by mathematicians Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Bellman-Ford is an algorithm that solves the shortest path problem from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph. As opposed to dijkstra algorithm, the algorithm can solve problem with negative weights, although it is slightly more expensive. Bellman-Ford operates based on relaxation process where for each of the node in a digraph, all neighbour are investigated for shortest path by comparing distance through parent s to existing shortest path. More details on the algorithm are available below:
